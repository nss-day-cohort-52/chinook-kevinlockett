Learning SQL with Chinook

Chinook is a sample database for SQL Server, SQLite, MySQL, etc. The Chinook data model represents a digital media store, including tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, customers, and more!

Based on the provided Chinook SQLite3 database, I created an ERD at https://dbdiagram.io/d/6213b7f7485e433543ef4929 to work from. I created individual files containing a query for each of the 27 challenges provided. Each challenge has been placed at the top of the .sql file in notation form.
